# MedSegFormer: Spatial-Channel Hybrid Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation


## Overview

Medical image segmentation is a critical task in healthcare, essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. MedSegFormer is a spatial-channel hybrid transformer designed to enhance segmentation capabilities in complex imaging scenarios, addressing challenges such as:

- Limited robustness across diverse imaging modalities.
- Inadequate handling of class imbalances.
- Dependency on large annotated datasets.

Our approach bridges critical gaps in pathology and radiology automation by introducing a novel transformer-based architecture tailored for medical image segmentation.
